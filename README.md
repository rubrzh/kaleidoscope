# Kaleidoscope
A portfolio of my work for the Whitney High School yearbook, Kaleidoscope.

## History

## About Me
I first joined Kaleidoscope in my sophomore year. I had an unfilled seventh period on my schedule, and I decided to join yearbook on a whim when my counselor suggested it as an option. That spontaneous decision has allowed me to embark on quite a journey. I have learned much and met a variety of wonderful people.

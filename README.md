## History
The first edition of Kaleidoscope was published in 1979. More recently, the yeabook advisor position, after being vacated by the retirement of the previous, has been so far held by three teachers. The pandemic marked a shift in our design principles, and we are currently undertaking a redesign of the book.

## About Me
I first joined Kaleidoscope in my sophomore year. I had an unfilled seventh period on my schedule, and I decided to join yearbook on a whim when my counselor suggested it as an option. That spontaneous decision has allowed me to embark on quite a journey. I have learned much and met a variety of wonderful people.

At the end of my first year in Kaleidoscope, I was promoted to People Editor and Organs co-Editor. With these new positions, I had to take on some new responsibilities, designing spreads chief among them. Last year, for our 2022 edition, I was able to design one spread in our summer supplement as training. This year, I will designing a multitude, though those cannot be revealed until the book is released.
